<p>18F employees live all over the country. We work out of homes in Dayton and Tucson, St. Louis and Chapel Hill &#x2014; and in federal buildings in San Francisco, Chicago, New York City, and Washington D.C.</p>

<p>That means many of our project teams are also made up of distributed employees working all over the country. For example, you may have a developer in Austin, a designer in Washington D.C., and a content strategist in Portland &#x2014; but they&#x2019;re all working on the same team and with the same partners.</p>

<p>Because we work on distributed teams so frequently, we&apos;ve developed certain strategies for working well as a collaborative operation.</p>
