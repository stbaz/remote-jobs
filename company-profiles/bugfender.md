# Bugfender

## Company blurb

Bugfender is a mobile app remote logger, crash reporter and in-app user feedback tool - all in one.

As developers at Mobile Jazz, we’ve built many apps across all mobile platforms. When doing so, however, we found a lack of good tools for remotely gathering app logs to get key information at the right time. That’s why we decided to build Bugfender — to provide the best remote logger on the market, with the options and features you need for a better development experience.
