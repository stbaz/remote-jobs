# Impira

## Company blurb

[Impira](https://www.impira.com/) was founded in 2017 and is backed by top institutional investors and industry leaders.  Powered by artificial intelligence, Impira uses technologies like OCR, computer vision, and object recognition to help you extract, organize, search, and analyze invoices, contracts, and images.

As businesses become increasingly digital, visual forms of data such as images, videos, PDFs, and documents, have exploded in volume. However, traditional tools like databases, spreadsheets, and dashboards have been ill-equipped to manage such content. As a result, teams are left spending precious time searching, retyping, and recreating visual assets across multiple systems.  At Impira, we realized that re-engineering the data processing stack, with AI at its core, could unlock the valuable information buried within visual data. Our product is ambitious â€” we believe that if we are successful, we can unleash incredible amounts of productivity by cataloging, analyzing, and interpreting visual data at scale.
