## Company blurb

Trusted experts in enterprise development.

Developers today are tasked with building larger systems than ever before. It's not just about scalability - the world we're modeling is much more intricate. Unfortunately, the traditional approaches don't hold up anymore and the behemoth enterprise programming stacks are just too complex.After decades of working with these convoluted layers of abstraction and obstruction, our team has found the "middle road". We've restructured the rock-solid underlying technologies from these behemoths into a platform just as stable but much simpler and easier to use.Our customers include the world largest banks, retailers, auto manufacturers, insurance companies, energy and media powerhouses - across every industry, from the smallest startups to the Global 2000, thousands rely on our platform.

## Company size

We have over 40 staff members worldwide.

## Remote status

We’re fully distributed. This means that there is no central office. We all work from home (and coffee shops and essentially everywhere we can find a reliable wifi signal). We are spread across 15 countries, covering multiple timezones, conducting our work when it’s most suitable for us. Working remotely is great, but we feel it’s very important to work together face to face at least once a year. We meet in one place for five days to discuss the company direction for the following year, work together in person, and reinforce personal connections by having some fun. In addition, everyone has a personal budget for other meetups with colleagues throughout the world.

The company is divided into five core strategies managed by squads who are responsible for prioritizing work and making sure our processes and policies support the goals of the area. Participation in squads rotates periodically so that everyone gets the opportunity to develop their leadership skills and furthers their understanding of how areas in the company interconnect.

When a task or project is defined, a group of people with the necessary knowledge and skills form a task force. The work and decision-making happens in these small groups that form, complete the task, and disband. With task forces, we break down silos and get the chance to work with people from different disciplines.
