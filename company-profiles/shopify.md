# Shopify

## Company blurb

Shopify is a multi-channel commerce platform for small and medium businesses that lets you create a shop and sell products wherever you want: online via web store or social media and offline with a POS card reader. Shopify powers 600K merchants and serves 80K requests per second at peak.

## Company size

5000+

## Remote status

Shopify has gone digital by default.

Digital by default represents a digital-first way of thinking, working, and making decisions. It means the freedom to work from anywhere and the opportunity to build solutions that help Shopifyâ€™s merchants and partners innovate through chaos and emerge, stronger and more adaptable than ever before.
