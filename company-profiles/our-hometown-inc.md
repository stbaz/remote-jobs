# Our-Hometown Inc.

## Company blurb
Our-Hometown, Inc. was founded with the goal of helping communities leverage the latest technology for spreading local news on the internet.

In the early days of the company, our team actually took photos & created the online content, acting as journalists in the early stages of digital media. However, given the rich value of journalism covered by community newspapers, we quickly recognized the opportunity that existed in helping these established newsrooms move their publications online.

At this point we switched Our-Hometownâ€™s focus to providing expertise in website design, content management, & digital subscription software.
