## Company technologies

There are 3 ways for a customer to enjoy the benefits of ChefsClub: through the iOS app (Swift), Android app (Java) or through our web app (React). All of these projects communicate with a Rest API developed with a stable version of Ruby on Rails and ElasticSearch.

There is no infrastructure team since we develop a devops culture, so we love Heroku and AWS services.

Read more about the technologies we use [here](https://stackshare.io/felipetio2/chefsclub). However, it’s much more important than have experience with technologies we use, you behave as a curious mind, enjoys learning new things quickly and understand the core concepts behind libraries and frameworks that you master.
