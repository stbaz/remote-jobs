# Nuna Inc

## Company blurb
At [Nuna](https://www.nuna.com), our mission is to make high-quality healthcare affordable for everyone. We’re dedicated to tackling one of our nation’s biggest problems with ingenuity, creativity, and a keen moral compass.

Nuna builds data platforms and analytics solutions to help healthcare decision-makers like government programs, large employers, and health plans understand cost and quality trends. With these insights, they can make changes that increase access to effective, affordable care. We have a deep bench of engineering, data science, design, and policy expertise under one roof, which lets us serve as a one-stop problem solving shop.

## Company size
100-200

## Remote status
Supporting a healthy remote culture requires investment and iteration and Nuna has made a commitment to both. Three core areas that make a huge impact on remote success: 

* Communication: To get our work done - and connected to one another in community - we use a variety of technologies.  From video conferencing, to Slack, to JIRA, we equip all Nunas with the tools to share, get feedback, and feel part of the team. 
* Remote Leadership: Remote leaders make great advocates for remote culture because they reinforce habits that build a healthy remote culture. The team naturally gravitates towards remote-first practices, even if some of them sit next to each other in the office.
* In-person meet-ups:  There’s no replacement for face-to-face time with others. Understanding that personal connections with others are crucial, Nuna holds a yearly offsite retreat for the entire company. Individual teams within the company can meet in person more frequently, and Nuna supports flying individuals to the office at least once per quarter.
