# Enjoei

## Company blurb

Enjoei is a marketplace focused on fashion, but there are many different things available, such as furniture, accessories and household appliances. People can sell and buy secondhand items using the site and the app. 

## Company size

Between 51-200, according to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/enjoei).

## Remote status

Partially remote. Some jobs vacancies are 100% remote while some are presential.

## Region
Brazil
The region is not mentioned anywhere, but there are some things to consider: the description of their job opportunities are in Brazilian Portuguese and only a few of them mention the ability to speak English. Therefore, it is likely that the candidate needs to be able to communicate in Portuguese for some vacancies.
